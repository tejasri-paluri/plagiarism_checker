One sunny afternoon, a hungry fox was walking through an orchard. He spotted a bunch of juicy grapes hanging from a high vine.

His mouth watered. "Just what I need!" he said.

He jumped once—missed.
He jumped again—still too high.
He backed up, took a running leap—still no luck.

Tired and frustrated, the fox gave up. As he walked away, he muttered to himself:

"Those grapes were probably sour anyway."
